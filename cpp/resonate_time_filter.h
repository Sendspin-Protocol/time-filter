/// @brief Two-dimensional Kalman filter for NTP-style time synchronization between client and server.
///
/// This class implements a time synchronization filter that tracks both the timestamp offset and clock drift rate
/// between a client and server. It processes measurements obtained with NTP-style time messages that contain round-trip
/// timing information to optimally estimate the time relationship while accounting for network latency uncertainty.
///
/// The filter maintains a 2D state vector [offset, drift] with associated covariance matrix to track estimation
/// uncertainty. An adaptive forgetting factor helps the filter recover quickly from network disruptions or server clock
/// adjustments.
///
/// All computations use double precision arithmetic to maintain microsecond-level accuracy over extended periods.
/// Thread-safe access to the current time transformation is provided via std::mutex.
class ResonateTimeFilter {

  /// @param process_std_dev Standard deviation of the offset process noise in microseconds, modeling clock jitter.
  /// @param drift_process_std_dev Standard deviation of the drift process noise in microseconds/second, modeling
  ///                              frequency wander.
  /// @param forget_factor Forgetting factor (>1) applied to covariances when large residuals are detected.
  ///                      Higher values enable faster recovery from disruptions but may reduce stability.
  /// @param adaptive_cutoff Fraction of max_error (0-1) that triggers adaptive forgetting. Default 0.75.
  ///                        When residual > adaptive_cutoff * max_error, forgetting is applied.
